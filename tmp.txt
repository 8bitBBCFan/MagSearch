Turn your ideas
into reality!
This is not your ordinary
computer magazine!
MakerSpace focuses on
technology you can use to
build your own stuff.
If you’re interested in
electronics but haven’t
had the time or the skills
(yet), studying these maker
projects might be the final
kick to get you started.
